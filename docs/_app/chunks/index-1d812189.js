Well, with no Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games none of this would have become a reality.","Hosting the Games was crucial in now impacting positively the lives of Cariocas, many of which might never have come to fruition without the momentum generated by the event.","Since the beginning of the project, the Rio City Hall has strived to secure a lasting legacy for the city and its inhabitants. The preparations for hosting the event were leveraged to accelerate long-awaited changes, resulting in significant enhancements to the quality of life for Rio residents.","The Olympic and Paralympic Games represented a milestone in the city's recent history. In addition to putting Rio in the global spotlight, the Games paved the way for significant transformations in infrastructure, services, transportation, and education.","In this special report, we invite you to revisit or discover the Olympic legacy that has transformed \u2014 and continues to transform \u2014 our Rio de Janeiro."],Oa=["In addition to planning and building facilities to guarantee a better quality of life for the Cariocas, Rio's Olympic project adopted the nomadic architecture in several arenas. This meant that, after the Games, these facilities would have new uses for the population.","This construction concept foresees the reuse of sports facilities to transform them into other public facilities, even extending to other areas within the city. A prime example is the Future Arena, originally utilized for Olympic handball and Paralympic goalball.  Following the conclusion of these competitions, the arena's infrastructure was repurposed to construct four schools following the GET (Educational Technological Gymnasium) model, with the capacity to accommodate a total of 1,700 students.","All four units are located in the West Zone of the city (Santa Cruz, Bangu, Campo Grande, and Rio das Pedras), where other important facilities were built and are now part of the Olympic legacy."],Ba=["Beyond the mentioned facilities, numerous other projects form part of the legacy, not directly tied to the sporting event but capitalized on the Olympic opportunity to materialize. These infrastructure endeavors, primarily focused on mobility and urban development, whose realization or acceleration was made possible by Rio's hosting of the Games.","One of the most significant transformations refers to the expansion of the high-capacity transportation network. The efforts aimed to create a new model of urban mobility in which the city was completely interconnected, facilitating and speeding up displacements and breaking old geographical and social barriers.","To achieve this, investments were made in projects such as the Transoeste, Transcarioca, and Transol\xEDmpica BRT lines, the LRV, and more recently, the Gentileza Terminal. These works boosted transportation in the city, reducing distances and improving the quality of life for thousands of cariocas, especially in the North and West zones.","Next, you will learn more about the Olympic Legacy mobility projects that have expedited and facilitated how Cariocas get around Rio."],Ca=["In the next phase of the Rio de Janeiro City Hall's ongoing commitment to preserving and remembering the Olympic legacy, totems, plaques, and seals will be installed in various spaces and buildings throughout the city.","By and commemorating the sites that underwent transformation or reaped benefits from the Games, we reinforce the community's unity and sense of belonging, simultaneously fostering tourism and raising awareness about the event's <br>significance for our present and future.</b>"],Ia=["Explore all the equipment and works done due to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the city of Rio in the tool below:"],Pa="",Ga="",La="",Da="Imaginary God of <strong>Death</strong>",Sa="Imaginary God of <strong>Fertility</strong>",qa="",Ha="",ja="",Fa="Tlaltecuhtli",Va="Colorized detail from a stone sculpture exhibited at the Templo Mayor museum",Ja="",Na="Tezcatlipoca",Wa="Codex Borgia",Qa="http://www.famsi.org/research/loubat/Borgia/page_21.jpg",Za=[{id:"allLinks",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"allLinks",selected:"BRT",keyword:"educacao",text:"<em>Death</em> groups all the gods related to destructive forces, whether they come from nature or humankind, like the underworld, war or natural disasters."},{id:"allLinks",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"allLinks",selected:"",keyword:"transporte",text:"<em>Life</em>, like death, combines both renewal of nature and the continuation of the human species and, thus, includes fertility, birth, food or even cosmic creation."},{id:"allLinks",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"allLinks",selected:"",keyword:"urban reforms",text:"<em>Spiritual</em> can be gods related to human intellectual interests, like art, lust and excess, or gods related to metaphysical interests, like the mysteries of nature, its creation and its purpose."},{id:"allLinks",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"allLinks",selected:"",keyword:"leisure",text:"<em>Material</em> deities offer protection to the activities that ensure the survival of Aztec civilization, from trading and craft to war or food."},{id:"allLinks",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"allLinks",selected:"",keyword:"",text:"But, as we\u2019ve seen with Tlaltecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca, Aztec Gods rarely fit into a single category, and most are both creative and destructive, spiritual and material, especially the 13 <span class=major-god>major Gods</span>."},{id:"aspect",title:"",type:"explanatory-mode",layout:"aspect",selected:"",keyword:"",text:"Explore each illustration to see if you can spot the attributes that align with the Gods\u2019 domains.
