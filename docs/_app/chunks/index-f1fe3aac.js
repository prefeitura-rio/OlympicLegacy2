Well, without the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, none of this would have become a reality.","The hosting of the Games was crucial in making various urban facilities that now positively impact the lives of Cariocas a reality, many of which might never have materialized without the impetus provided by the event.","Since the project's inception, the Rio City Hall has aimed to ensure a great legacy for the city and its residents. The preparation for the event was used to accelerate long-awaited changes, which brought significant improvements to the quality of life for Cariocas.","The Olympics and Paralympics represented a milestone in the city's recent history.

This meant that after the Games, these facilities would have new uses for the population.","This construction concept foresees the reuse of sports facilities to transform them into other public facilities, including in other areas of the city. This is the case of the Future Arena, which hosted Olympic handball and Paralympic goalball. After the end of the competitions, its structure was used to build four schools in the GET (Educational Technological Gymnasium) model, with the capacity to serve 1,700 students.","All four units are located in the West Zone of the city (Santa Cruz, Bangu, Campo Grande, and Rio das Pedras), where other important facilities were built and are now part of the Olympic legacy."],xa=["In addition to the aforementioned facilities, many other projects are part of the legacy that are not directly related to the sporting event but took advantage of the Olympic opportunity to become a reality. These were infrastructure works, mainly related to mobility and urbanization, which were made feasible or accelerated because Rio became the host city of the Games.","One of the most significant transformations refers to the expansion of the high-capacity transportation network. The efforts of the Rio City Hall aimed to create a new model of urban mobility in which the city was completely interconnected, facilitating and speeding up displacements and breaking old geographical and social barriers.","To achieve this, investments were made in projects such as the Transoeste, Transcarioca, and Transol\xEDmpica BRT lines, the VLT, and more recently, the Gentileza Terminal. These works boosted transportation in the city, reducing distances and improving the quality of life for thousands of cariocas, especially in the North and West zones.
